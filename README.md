This is an attempt at Arudino based thermostat for my home.
I should go buy a Nest, but how about a big project box on the wall instead?

End State Goals:

* Automatic shift from cooling to heating
* Display of closest set point temp and current temp
* Fan cycling every ~hour to keep my upstairs from melting in the summer
* Vacation mode
* Filter reminder
